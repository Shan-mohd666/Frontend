        <h2>Ingriedients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Ghee: </strong>Making this UP style vegetable and rice dish in ghee really helps alleviate the flavors and makes it taste richer. You can replace it with oil if you’re vegan, but ghee delivers the best flavor. </li>
            <li><strong>Spices: </strong>This recipe uses just a handful of spices that deliver big flavors. I have used cumin seeds, turmeric, coriander, and chilli powders as well green chillies.   </li>
            <li><strong>Onions:</strong> For flavor and aroma. </li>
            <li><strong>Veggies:</strong> I have used potatoes and fresh green peas for this recipe. </li>
            <li><strong>Rice:</strong> I have used basmati rice, but any long grain rice will work well for this recipe. </li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong> For flavor and seasoning</li>

        </ol>
        <h2>How to make Tahari</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat ghee in a pan over medium flame. Add jeera (cumin) and once it starts spluttering, add green chillies and onions.</li>

            <li>Sauté onions for a minute just to soften them a bit and add coriander powder, turmeric powder, chilli powder and salt.</li>
                
            <li>Stir to combine. Cook until the raw aroma from the masalas disappears.</li>
                
            <li>Add potatoes, green peas and the drained rice.</li>
